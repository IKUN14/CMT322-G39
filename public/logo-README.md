# Logo Icon Setup

## How to Add the System Logo

1. Place your logo image file in the `public` folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the path in `src/layouts/MainLayout.vue`)
3. Recommended size: 40x40px to 128x128px
4. Supported formats: PNG, SVG, JPG

The logo will automatically appear:
- In the header next to the system title
- As the browser favicon (tab icon)

If the logo file is not found, it will be automatically hidden (no broken image icon).
